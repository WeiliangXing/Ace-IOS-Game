# Ace-IOS-Game
This is an developed ios game for a new card game in swift 0.0 beta

This work shows my experience to explore the new language swift
begining since Jun.2016 in long island high tech incubator. The game is designed to implement new rules for classic card game.

File 'HowToPlay.pdf' (with password angelhack)shows the basic rules. Besides coding, I also engaged in the game rules design showing in this instructure.

The game is coded and worked in swift beta version. Since that, the language evoluted so fast after I finished my work that the game is not compatible. Due to the company did not update the newest version and out date of confidential agreement, I am allowed to realize the work. 

Great appreciation is given to Adam Ciffone, the CEO and designer for this game. He recently published a game book
"A curiosity Turbulent" in Amazon.com. 

Also I give thanks to Xiaoan Yan, a greate developer that helps me understanding objective-c that I could translate objective-c code in public source code to swift for self-learning due to very limited resources for new-born Swift.
